## Introduction

This is the code repository for the **FIWARE Short Time Historic (STH) - Comet**, a component able to manage (storing and retrieving) historical context information as raw and aggregated time series context information.

This project is part of [FIWARE](http://www.fiware.org).

Any feedback on this documentation is highly welcome, including bugs, typos or things you think should be included but aren't. You can use [github issues](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-sth-comet/issues/new) to provide feedback.

You can find the Users & Developers Manual and the Installation & Administration Manual on [readthedocs.org](https://fiware-sth-comet.readthedocs.org)

## Overall description

The **FIWARE Short Time Historic (STH) - Comet** is a component of the [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/) ecosystem in charge of managing (storing and retrieving) historical raw and aggregated time series context information about the evolution in time of context data (i.e., entity attribute values) registered in an [Orion Context Broker](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion) instance.

All the communications between the STH and the Orion Context Broker as well as between the STH and any third party (typically for data retrieval) use standardized NGSI9 and [NGSI10](http://technical.openmobilealliance.org/Technical/technical-information/release-program/current-releases/ngsi-v1-0) interfaces.

If this is your first contact with the STH component, it is highly recommended that you visit the [Getting started](doc/manuals/getting-started.md) guide where we introduce some basic concepts upon which the STH component leans on all the functionality it offers.

In case you are curious about why we called this component **Comet**, you can also visit the [Why Comet](doc/manuals/why-comet.md) section of the documentation.

## API overview

The STH component exposes a REST API covering 4 main functionalities:

1. **Historical raw and aggregated time series context information storage**: The STH component exposes an endpoint where the notifications generated by a Context Broker instance (whenever an entity attribute value changes) can be received, processed and its associated raw and aggregated time series context information stored in an associated MongoDB database instance.
2. **Raw context information retrieval**: The STH component allows the query and retrieval of historical raw context information, this is the concrete values an entity attribute took overtime, including the concrete timestamps when the value of the attributes changed.
3. **Aggregated time series context information**: The STH component allows the query and retrieval of historical aggregated time series context information, this is information about the evolution of the entity attribute values grouped by time making it straight-forward to get distinct probabilistic measures such as means, standard deviations, maximum and minimum values, as well as the number of occurrences.
4. **Raw and aggregated time series context information removal**: The STH component allows the removal of the raw and aggregated time series context information about the desired attributes and entities.

These APIs are detailed in the next section.
